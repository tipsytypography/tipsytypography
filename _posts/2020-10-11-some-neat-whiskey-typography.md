Typically, when people think of whiskey drinkers, they are more likely to be male than female. Is the mainly-male target audience reflected in the typography of whiskey brands? Let's see by exploring a variety of whiskey brands and their typography.

## Jack Daniel's

Jack Daniel's was established in [1866, with the 'Old No. 7' whiskey in Tennessee, USA.](https://www.jackdaniels.com/en-gb/our-story) The exact type used for the 'Jack Daniel's' part of the branding is unknown but it is similar to [Black No. 7 designed by Stefan Huebsch](https://fontmeme.com/jack-daniels-font/#:~:text=About%20Jack%20Daniels%20Font&text=Its%20wordmark%20Jack%20Daniel's%20was,Jackie_regular%20Alternative%20by%20Dario%20Muhafara.). The typography is a bold serif, and is monospaced and condensed, with quite a high contrast. The boldness of the type and the simple white-on-black of the branding suggests a bolshy, more masculine target audience. 

However, the brand uses a variety of typefaces in its logo, with the 'Tennessee' part of the branding in a scripted, high contrast type, similar to that of [Jackie_regular Alternative by Dario Muhafara](https://fontmeme.com/jack-daniels-font/#:~:text=About%20Jack%20Daniels%20Font&text=Its%20wordmark%20Jack%20Daniel's%20was,Jackie_regular%20Alternative%20by%20Dario%20Muhafara.). The scripted style of this part of the branding perhaps suggests the classic and traditional sense of the brand.

## Jim Beam[](https://fontmeme.com/jack-daniels-font/#:~:text=About%20Jack%20Daniels%20Font&text=Its%20wordmark%20Jack%20Daniel's%20was,Jackie_regular%20Alternative%20by%20Dario%20Muhafara.)

Jim Beam is a [straight bourbon whiskey established in 1795 in Kentucky, USA.](https://www.jimbeam.com/) The official typeface used in Jim Beam branding is unknown but the brand uses a bold, serif type. The typeface has a high X-height in comparison to its cap-height and its lettering has a high contrast but is monospaced. The typography also includes shadowing. 

Like with Jack Daniel's, the boldness of the type and the serifs used seems to target an audience with a male majority and also reflect the trusted, traditional brand.



## Glenfiddich

Glenfiddich, [Gaelic for Valley of the Deer, was established in 1887 by William Grant in the Scottish Highlands.](https://www.glenfiddich.com/uk/family-story/)
